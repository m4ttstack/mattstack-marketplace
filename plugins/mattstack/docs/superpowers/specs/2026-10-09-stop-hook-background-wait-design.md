# Stop hook: let a turn end while a background task is pending

**Date:** 2026-10-09
**Status:** draft from an independent review of one pipeline session; open decisions below are Matt's to make
**Builds on:** `2026-09-01-pipeline-gates-design.md` (section 5, the Stop hook). Nothing that spec settled changes except what section 5 says a Stop means.

## Problem

Claude Code moves any MCP call still running after 120 s to the background
("moved to the background as task `<id>`") and re-invokes the session with a
`<task-notification>` when it finishes. `ci_watch` with a long
`maxWaitSeconds` is always such a call, and so is every async `Agent`.

The pipeline gate Stop hook (`hooks/pipeline-gate-stop.sh`) was written on
the premise that a Stop under a `running` run means the agent ended in
prose. A pending background task is a sixth case the hook cannot see, so it
blocks the turn. Blocked, the agent waits in the foreground instead
(`python3 -c "import time; time.sleep(540)"`, which the shell tool's
foreground-sleep block does not catch), and keeps doing so for the rest of
the session even when nothing blocks it any more.

In the reviewed session this cost about 3% of the session's cache-read
tokens (eight sleep wakes that had nothing to deliver) and, worse, delayed
the `ci_watch` result itself by 3.5 minutes and any chat or user message by
up to the length of the sleep. The two earlier blocks in that session were
async `Agent`s, not MCP: the hole is "background task", not `ci_watch`.

The stage skill also never says that a backgrounded `ci_watch` may end the
turn: its graph reads "running: call again" and nothing else, so even with
the hook fixed an agent that has learned to sleep has no reason to stop.

## Fix

1. **The hook allows a Stop while a background task is pending.** It reads
   `transcript_path` from the Stop input and scans the session transcript
   for background tasks that have started and not yet been delivered:
   - an MCP call backgrounded (`moved to the background as task <id>` in a
     tool result);
   - an async agent launched (`toolUseResult.status: "async_launched"`,
     `agentId`);
   - minus any task whose notification was delivered (a `queue-operation`
     `remove`, or a `queued_command` attachment, naming the `<task-id>`) or
     that the agent stopped (`TaskStop` with that `task_id`).
   - A launch line marked `isSidechain` never counts: a subagent's own
     backgrounded call is not the parent's.

   A launch that is enqueued but not yet delivered still counts as pending:
   the delivery is what re-invokes the pane, and it happens the moment the
   turn ends.

   A pending task older than a fixed bound is ignored (background tasks
   "do not survive exiting this session" and emit no notification when they
   die, so without a bound one stale launch would hold the gate open for
   the life of the transcript). The scan reads only the last 64 MB of the
   transcript (a launch older than that window is not seen, so it blocks).
   A scan over its time cap, a missing `transcript_path`, or any parse
   error falls through to today's block. The scan runs only after the hook has already
   found this session's open run, so a session with no run pays nothing.

2. **Background shell tasks are ignored on purpose.** `rt gate wait` is
   covered by `waiting-gate`, and a dev server never finishes.

3. **The stage skill names the exit.** `attachments/pipeline/stage-watch-ci`
   gains the one branch the incident lacked: when `ci_watch` comes back
   backgrounded, end the turn in one line; the task notification re-invokes
   the stage with the result as the `ci_watch state`.

4. **The three sentences that state the old invariant change with it:**
   `attachments/gate-protocol/SKILL.md` ("Under a run a turn ends only with
   `waiting-gate` or `hold` set"), the `hooks/README.md` row for the hook,
   and a dated note under section 5 of the 2026-09-01 spec.

No run field, no console or board change, no rt change.

## Acceptance

- Under a `running` run with a backgrounded MCP call whose notification has
  not been delivered, the hook exits 0 and prints nothing.
- The same with an async agent launched and not yet delivered: exit 0.
- A launch whose `<task-id>` was delivered (`queue-operation` `remove` or a
  `queued_command` attachment): exit 2, today's message.
- A launch the agent ended with `TaskStop`: exit 2.
- A launch enqueued but not delivered: exit 0.
- A background shell task alone (`backgroundTaskId` in a Bash result): exit 2.
- A pending launch older than the age bound: exit 2.
- A launch line marked `isSidechain`: exit 2.
- The scan reads only the last 64 MB of the transcript: a pending launch
  inside that window exits 0, and one older than the window is not seen,
  so it exits 2.
- No `transcript_path`, a missing file, a line
  the scan must read (one carrying a task marker) that is not JSON, or a
  scan past its time cap: exit 2, today's message. Lines with no marker
  are skipped unread.
- A session with no running run never opens the transcript.
- Every fixture is a real transcript line from the reviewed session with
  paths, URLs, shas, branch names and prompts replaced by neutral values.
- The hook's existing tests still pass (`hooks/tests/test-pipeline-gate-stop.sh`,
  `tests/test-gate-stop-hook.sh`).
- `stage-watch-ci`'s graph has the backgrounded branch, passes
  `check-dot.py` and `tests/certify.sh`, and a fresh agent given the
  backgrounded `ci_watch` result ends its turn instead of sleeping (GREEN),
  where the same agent without the edit slept (RED).
- `gate-protocol/SKILL.md`, `hooks/README.md` and the 2026-09-01 spec say
  the new rule.
- `plugin.json` version is bumped in the commit that changes the skill.

## Decided (2026-10-09)

1. **Age bound:** a pending launch older than 120 minutes (by its launch
   line's timestamp) no longer counts. No session-start boundary.
2. **Background shell tasks are ignored.** The GitHub branch's "sleep 60 as
   a background Bash task" path stays as it is.
3. **CI coverage:** the `plugin-mattstack` job gains one step that runs both
   hook test scripts.
4. **The plan stays local** in the gitignored plans folder; only this spec
   is committed.
5. **Caps:** the scan reads only the last 64 MB of a transcript and gives
   up after 1.5 s (or sooner when the hook's 5 s timeout is near), falling
   back to today's block. (Amended in review from 'skip a transcript over
   64 MB': long sessions run past 200 MB and would never get the fix.)
6. **The standalone `watch-ci` engine** gets the same backgrounded branch
   in the same PR.

## Out of scope

- A `waiting-task` run field, console `PLUMBING_KEYS`, or any board change.
- Changing `ci_watch`'s defaults or caps, or the agent's choice of
  `maxWaitSeconds`.
- Resumed agents: an agent resumed through `SendMessage` after its first
  notification writes no launch line, so the hook does not count it.
- A session resumed with `--resume` within the age bound: its old launch
  lines still count although the tasks died with the old process (no
  session-start boundary, decision 1).
- The daemon-side idle nudge from the 2026-09-01 spec.

## Source

Review of one pipeline session's transcript (2026-10-08 to 2026-10-09):
three Stop blocks in 357 requests, two during async agents and one during a
backgrounded `ci_watch`; 31 foreground sleeps, 8 with nothing to deliver.
