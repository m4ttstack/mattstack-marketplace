# stage: ship

{{stage.fields}}

Run state: the orchestrator opens and closes this stage, so never write
`run_stage` `start` or `done` here. Read consumes with `run_field_get`,
write `mr` with `run_field_set` (`stage: "ship"`) the moment it exists,
and on failure write `run_stage {action: fail, stage: "ship", reason}`
naming what failed. `<root>` is the worktree root, the absolute path
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints.

The domain rules below run their own steps in their own order. This graph
is where every mechanical move in them lands.

### Run the domain steps before the gate (none when unbound)

The domain's gathering steps: sanity of the diff against the ticket, the
branch and ticket checks, an existing-MR lookup, any mandatory pre-ship
review. Each one that raises a question adds it to the `ship` gate rather
than asking on its own.

### Run the domain's fast checks (none when unbound)

Only the checks the domain names, on the changed files. Revert generated
drift the checks leave behind before continuing. A full suite the domain
rules out stays out: CI runs it.

### Fix test-first, commit, rerun

Each fix gets its failing test first, then the fix, then a commit. The
counter is fix rounds within this pass through the stage.

### Resolve the files, then git rebase --continue on Bash

Resolve each conflicted file `git_rebase` returned, then continue the
rebase on Bash (no tool continues one). A later commit that conflicts
counts as another round. Once a rebase finishes, clean or resolved, the
fast checks run again because the tree changed under them, and then the
push follows: this pass never starts a second rebase. A continue that
fails with anything but another conflict aborts the rebase, then fails
the stage with the error quoted.

### Capture the AFTER when the domain names one

The same view as the BEFORE in `evidence`, on the sha you pushed. The
counter is attempts within this pass through the stage; after the third
failure, ship without it and say in the description what was tried.
Unbound, there is no AFTER.

### Off-script gate: mr_upload refused (gate-protocol, scope off-script:ship:<n>)

The upload guard refused a file past its one fix; a second timeout on
the same file reaches this gate too, and Iterate retries it once the
human has checked the daemon. Scope
`off-script:ship:<n>`, sharing `n` with the push's off-script gate,
`context` quoting the refusal and the path. Take writes the description
with the refused files' local paths linked instead of uploads, while files
already uploaded keep their upload markdown; Iterate means the human moved
the file, widened `rt.mcp.uploadRoots` or recaptured. Copying a file under
an allowed root is only ever the human's move: the roots are the boundary
on what leaves the machine.

### Write the title and description

Title from the ticket or the first commit subject; the body links the
ticket and every `evidence` entry, with the upload markdown where it
exists. The update replaces the whole body, so start from the one just
read back: keep what is already there (evidence the evidence stage
attached, a teammate's edits) and change only what this stage owns. The
domain's title, template and voice rules win over this paragraph.

### Gate clarify: which forge?

The origin host is neither GitLab nor GitHub. Ask which forge it is,
quoting the `git remote get-url origin` line as the context. Options:
**GitLab** / **GitHub** / **Hand back**, and `next`: **Proceed** /
**Hold**. `Forge clarify rounds = 2?` counts the times the host reads as
neither within this pass through the stage, this one included: the first
asks, and the second fails the stage with the origin URL and the answer
quoted. The named forge stands for the host from here on: this diamond
and every later forge diamond read the answer, never the origin URL
again, so the counter trips only when the answer names no forge this
stage knows.

## What the graph cannot show

- **Off-script answers.** Read `next` first: Hold ends the turn with no
  move made; Iterate means the human fixed the cause and ignores
  `action`; only Proceed applies `action`. Retrying `git_push` or
  `mr_upload` is Iterate, never Take; rounds count per stage attempt.
- After a rebase that rewrote already-pushed commits, push with
  `git_push {tree: <root>, forceWithLease: true}` instead. Never force
  otherwise, and never push a branch whose tests you have not seen pass in
  this session.
- `targetBranch` is the default branch read from git, never guessed. Keep
  the `url` `mr_create` returns as `mrUrl` for every later write.

## Gate `ship` (before the push)

One sentence above the form: the branch, the commits about to go, and
whether the tree is dirty. When the gate reopens with a rebase in progress
(the conflict rounds are spent), the context says so, since Abort or Go
back then aborts that rebase.

| Question | Options (recommended first) | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `dirty` | **Commit the changes** / **Stash them** / **Abort** | the tree is dirty |
| `open_as` | **Push and open as draft** / **Push and open ready** | always |
| the domain's own | as the domain rules word them (a ticket mismatch, an MR already open) | the domain declares them |
| `next` | **Proceed** / **Iterate here** / **Go back** / **Hold** | always |
| `to` | one option per earlier stage, split `to-1`, ... over 4 | Go back answered and more than one earlier stage row |

Selection: `{"dirty":"commit|stash|abort|null","open_as":"draft|ready","domain":{<answers>},"next":"proceed|iterate|redirect|hold","to":"<stage or null>","note":"<their words or null>"}`.
Abort pushes nothing and aborts a rebase in progress before the stage fails.
Go back also aborts a rebase in progress first, so the earlier stage never
receives a tree that is mid-rebase.
`Ship gate rounds = 2?` counts Iterate answers at this gate within this
pass through the stage, this one included: the first redoes the steps
before the gate with the note, and the second fails the stage with the
note quoted. `Ship gate reopenings = 2?` counts the times the fix or
conflict rounds run out and reopen this gate within this pass through
the stage, this one included: the first reopens it with the failing
output or conflicted files quoted, and the second fails the stage with
them quoted. The fix and conflict rounds carry over a reopen: the
reopened gate is the human's turn to fix it, so a Proceed whose checks
still fail reaches this counter again without new fix rounds. Either
failure aborts a rebase in progress first.

## Domain rules

The domain rules below supply content, checks and extra gate questions.
Where a domain step names a move the graph above marks STOP, the STOP
node's edge wins: a shell push fallback opens the push's off-script gate;
a GitLab CLI read or write goes through the `mr_*` tools.

{{slot:domain}}

When nothing is inlined above, the graph alone is the flow: no steps
before the gate, no fast checks, no rebase, no AFTER.
