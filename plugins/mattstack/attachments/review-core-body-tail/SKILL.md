## Assemble the draft

Fold your observations in; present exactly this shape:

- **Earlier threads** -- re-review passes only, and first: one entry per
  earlier thread the caller handed in, with its anchor, its call (one of
  the four the structured findings file names), what was checked, and the
  reply to post. **Issues** then hold only what is new.
- **Strengths** -- specific.
- **Issues** -- **Critical** (must fix) / **Important** (should fix) /
  **Minor** (nice to have). Every finding lands in one bucket, with
  `file:line`, what is wrong, why it matters, and the fix.
- **Assessment** -- Ready to merge: yes | no | with fixes, plus reasoning.

Those names and those three words are fixed vocabulary: downstream callers
read the draft by them. Return the draft; never post it, approve, or ship.

## Structured findings file

Whenever the draft is written to a report file, write a sibling with the
report path's `.md` swapped for `.json`, machine-readable, mirroring the
draft exactly (never re-judged). It is version 3 of this file:

- Required: `version` (`3`), `summary` ({`readiness`: `yes` | `no` |
  `with-fixes`, `reasoning`: the assessment's qualifier in one or two
  sentences; the draft's spaced "Ready to merge: with fixes" maps to
  readiness `with-fixes`, hyphenated, never the spaced form) and
  `findings`: one entry per finding, in report order, `id` stable
  (`f1, f2, ...`), with `tier` (`Critical` | `Important` | `Minor`,
  exactly the draft's buckets), `kind` (nitpick / suggestion / thought /
  confirmation / question, or the closest word), `title`, `body` (the
  finding in full as the draft states it, what is wrong and why it
  matters; the posting gate shows it verbatim, so never shorten it),
  `file` and `line` when the finding anchors to the diff (else
  `fileLabel` with the anchor text, e.g. "not inline-anchorable"), and
  `fix` (one line).
- `evidence` on a finding whenever the run produced output that backs it
  (a failing test's lines, a command's result): that output verbatim,
  never paraphrased.
- Re-review passes only (the caller framed the review as a re-review):
  `re_review: true`, and `threads`: one entry per earlier thread the
  caller handed in, in the order given, never one the caller did not
  hand in:
  `{discussionId, file, line, round, call, original, authorReply, note,
  reply}`. `discussionId`, `round` and `original` (the reviewer's own
  first note, verbatim) come from the caller unchanged; `file` and `line`
  are the thread's anchor when it has one; `authorReply` is the author's
  latest note in the thread, verbatim, omitted when they wrote none.
  `call` is this pass's verdict on the thread, one of four:
  `fixed` (the code now does what the thread asked), `not-fixed` (it does
  not, and the author gave no reason that holds), `pushback-accepted`
  (the author declined and their reason holds), `pushback-rejected` (the
  author declined and their reason does not hold). `note` is one line
  saying what was checked to reach the call. `reply` is the reply to post
  in that thread, written in the writing style, never empty.
  `prior` is counted from the calls: `addressed` is `fixed` plus
  `pushback-accepted`, `still_open` is the other two.
- On a re-review, `findings` holds only what is new: an issue an earlier
  thread already raises lives on its thread and is never a finding. Each
  finding's `disposition` is `new` or absent.
- `skipped`, when the caller handed in findings the reviewer chose not to
  raise in earlier rounds: every one of them back, in the order given, as
  `{id, round, tier, title, file, line, excerpt, changed}`. `id`, `round`,
  `title`, `file`, `line` and `excerpt` are the caller's, unchanged, and
  `file` and `line` are left out when the caller's entry has none;
  `excerpt` is the finding's recorded text, its body and then, when it
  had a fix, a blank line and `Fix: <fix>`; `tier` is the caller's
  severity capitalised (`Critical` | `Important` | `Minor`). `changed` is
  true when the code the finding pointed at has moved since the round
  that skipped it: `git diff <that round's sha>..HEAD -- <file>` touches
  its line (any hunk in the file, for an entry with a `file` and no
  `line`), or, when a non-empty `snippet` was recorded, that snippet is
  no longer in the file (an empty `snippet` means none was recorded and
  tests nothing). When that round's sha is `unknown` or not in the
  checkout (`git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` fails: the MR was rebased or
  force-pushed), the snippet test alone decides, and with no snippet
  `changed` is false. It is false when the entry has no `file`.
- A would-be finding that says what a skipped one says, about the same
  code, is that skipped finding: it stays out of `findings` and is
  reported only under `skipped`. The reviewer already decided not to
  raise it; whether the code changed is what `changed` is for.
- From the run, not just the draft: `depth` (one line -- the REVIEW DEPTH
  line and what that setup found), `checks` (`[{tag, text}]`, tag `PASS` |
  `N/A` | `FAIL` -- the EVIDENCE CHECK line and each thing the setup
  observed, one entry apiece), `notes` (observations that are neither
  strengths nor findings, including post-merge follow-ups), `strengths`
  (`[{lead, detail}]`, the claim split from its receipts). A run that
  printed the depth and evidence lines has the material for `depth` and
  `checks`; omit a block only when the run produced nothing for it.
- The markdown report stays the human artifact and does not change; the
  json is the only machine-read path. Its readers are the review verb's
  Deliver (it builds the posting gate from the file), review-posting on a
  parked resume, and the board's report view; a field whose meaning
  changes bumps `version`, and those readers change with it. No terminal
  run without a report path writes either file.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's ~20 lines, or it's my own code" | The bias the fresh context removes. Dispatch it (the review dispatch step). |
| "I understand it from sizing it" | The understanding IS the bias. Dispatch it. |
| "I'll decide the depth as I go" | Print the block first (the review-depth step). |
| "Tests first, depth after" | Running them IS the depth decision, unprinted. Print, then set up. |
| "This writes up better its own way" | The five headings ARE the write-up; anything outside them is unreadable downstream. |
| "I'll post the findings myself" | Return the draft; the caller owns what follows. |

## Quick reference

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| Inputs in hand | Print REVIEW DEPTH / EVIDENCE CHECK and provider lines. |
| Criteria bound | Its triage lines into the block, its addendum into the dispatch. |
| About to judge the diff | Don't. The review dispatch flow (the dispatch step), reviewer shape, full payload. |
| Draft assembled | Buckets, `file:line`-what-why-fix, assessment word; return it; write the json sibling (version 3, every body in full) when a report path exists. |
