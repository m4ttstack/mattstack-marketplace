# Model Tiering

Start from the table's row for the work; where no row fits, start from
`opus`. Within a tier, tune **effort** before changing the tier: on
Anthropic's published cost-per-task measurements, raising effort usually
beats moving up a model, and `fable` earns its price only where `opus` at
higher effort still falls short. An omitted model flag inherits the parent's model and an omitted effort
inherits the harness default, so every spawn names both.

## Delegate or do it inline

A sub-agent starts cold: tens of thousands of tokens of system prompt and
tools before it reads anything, then it re-gathers the context you already
hold. Your own context is cached and cheap to reread. Do the work inline
unless one of these holds:

- **Reading you do not need**: many files skimmed or searched, where only the
  summary comes back.
- **Independent pieces in parallel**: work that splits cleanly and runs at the
  same time.
- **Long output or many sequential steps** on a model much cheaper than yours.

A small mechanical edit you already know how to make stays inline: you would
batch it in one step, and a hand-off costs more than it saves.

## The tier table

Tiers are **aliases**, not model IDs. Aliases point to the provider's
recommended version and update over time, so the table survives model
releases; resolution is provider-dependent (Bedrock, Foundry, and Google
Cloud resolve `opus` and `sonnet` differently from the first-party API). A
rejected alias exits 1 at launch -- a bad entry is a visible failure, not a
silent downgrade.

| Work shape | Tier | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Simple, high-volume, or disposable lookup; extraction; transcription plus testing (the brief carries the literal code) | `haiku` | `medium` |
| Mechanical execution -- complete spec, 2-3 files, existing pattern to follow | `sonnet` | `low` |
| Merge and verify -- merge branches, run verification, report; no new code | `sonnet` | `low` |
| Re-review of a small fix whose finding is known | `sonnet` | `medium` |
| Reading-heavy fan-out where each worker returns a judgment (an assessment, not a list) | `sonnet` | `medium` |
| First review of a small, low-risk diff -- mechanical, one concern, under about 100 lines | `sonnet` | `high` |
| Design / triage -- multiple valid approaches, cross-layer, product decisions | `opus` | `medium` |
| Review of a mid-sized diff or MR -- neither small and low-risk nor large or risky | `opus` | `high` |
| Long-horizon autonomous coding -- larger than one sitting | `opus` | `xhigh` |
| Review of a large or risky change -- concurrency, security, auth, money, data migrations, cross-cutting -- or a final whole-branch review | `opus` | `xhigh` |
| Escalation only -- `opus` at `xhigh` reached a wrong conclusion with full context, the user asks for it, or the reviewer floor needs it | `fable` | `high` |

When two rows fit, take the one further down the table: rows run from
cheapest to most capable. The four review rows split by scope and risk, so
pick a review's row by those, not by this tie-break.

**Floors.** `haiku` is only for work where the input already contains the
answer and the output is easy to check; on multi-step work it takes more
turns and costs more overall. A reviewer never runs on a weaker model than
the one that wrote the change under review (for a re-review, the fix): a
review exists to catch what the author missed. A change written on `fable`
gets a `fable` reviewer at the review row's effort.

**Other skills' tier words.** When another skill names a tier instead of a
model (superpowers says "cheap", "standard", "most capable"), place the work
in this table and take both the tier and the effort from its row. The word
only says where to look: cheap points at the `haiku` and `sonnet` rows,
standard at the `sonnet` rows, most capable at the `opus` rows. Where the
word and the work's shape disagree, the shape wins. `fable` stays
escalation-only.

**Excluded aliases.** `opusplan` upgrades only inside Claude Code's plan
permission mode, which skill-driven workers never enter -- do not re-add it.
`best` and `default` resolve by org entitlement, not work shape. `[1m]`
variants pick a context window, not a tier; when used, quote them
(`'opus[1m]'`) -- brackets are zsh glob characters.

## Two dispatch surfaces

| | Spawn-time (`claude` CLI, `herd_spawn`) | Delegation-time (Agent tool) |
|---|---|---|
| Model | alias or full ID | `model`: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable` |
| Effort | `--effort` flag, `effort` on `herd_spawn` | `effort`: `low` to `max` (ignored for a fork) |
| `best` / `default` / `[1m]` | accepted | rejected |
| Billing account | selectable at launch | inherits the caller's session |

The Agent tool's `effort` is set when a skill asks for it; this skill asks:
pass the table's effort on every delegation, or the escalated effort on a
re-dispatch.

## Effort

Effort trades thoroughness against tokens within one model, and work shapes
respond differently:

- **Coding and long-horizon agentic work repay effort.** On `opus`, `low`
  scored about 8 points below `high` at about a third of the cost; `xhigh`
  added about 1.4 points at 2.5x the cost.
- **Research, lookups, and knowledge work mostly do not.** `medium` matched
  the default; `low` gave up 1-3 points for a third to a half off.
- **Checkable output**: keep the row's effort for the batch and re-run only
  the failures at `high`.
- `max` only when the user asks for it.

Claude Code **clamps** an unsupported level to the highest supported level at
or below it, and organization effort caps clamp **silently** in background
agents and JSON output modes. `ultracode` is a Claude Code setting (xhigh
plus workflow orchestration), not a level in the ladder.

## The two discriminators

- **Right idea, sloppy execution** (skipped a file, did not run the tests,
  did not double-check) -> higher effort, same tier.
- **Wrong conclusion despite full context** -> higher effort first; next tier
  up once the model's ladder is spent (`haiku` or `sonnet` at `high`, then
  `opus`; `opus` at `xhigh`, then `fable`).

## Escalation

- Never retry a stuck agent **unchanged**.
- Missing context -> same tier and effort, re-dispatched with the context.
- Wrong despite full context on `opus` -> one step up the ladder per wrong attempt,
  counted from the effort the last attempt named (from its table row's effort
  when it named none): `low` -> `medium` -> `high` -> `xhigh` -> `fable` at
  `high`. `max` is off the ladder: only when the user asks for it. A wrong
  `haiku` or `sonnet` attempt re-runs on the same model at `high` (skipped
  when it already ran at `high`), then moves to `opus` at `medium` (a review
  at `high`) and climbs from there.

## Complexity signals

Use these to place a unit of work in the table:

- **File count and isolation.** A single file with the fix fully specified =
  do it inline or `haiku`. 2-3 files with a clear spec = mechanical. Multi-file
  with integration concerns = design.
- **Spec completeness.** Brief contains the exact code or precise
  instructions = mechanical. Brief describes intent and constraints = design.
- **Decision load.** Zero design decisions left = mechanical. Any product,
  architecture, or pattern decision = design.
- **Existing pattern.** Adding a field along an existing pattern, renaming,
  copy tweak = mechanical. New pattern, new component, new abstraction =
  design.

When in doubt, raise effort before raising the tier.

## Tiering is recursive

A design-tier agent that runs the superpowers chain (brainstorming, spec,
plan, implement) dispatches its implementer sub-agents by the same table. The
plan's task descriptions carry the complexity signals: a task touching 2-3
files with complete code in the spec is mechanical; a task requiring broad
codebase understanding is design.

## Domain overrides

Skills layered on top of this one may set a floor ("never use model X in
this repo"), a ceiling ("nothing above `opus` at `xhigh`"), or a default
("ticket-driven work defaults to Opus because triage happens inside the
worker"). Those overrides are domain-specific; this skill is the generic
framework they override.
