# review

The standalone entry for reviewing someone else's change. The graph below
is the run: follow its edges, and treat a move it does not show as a
question for a gate, never as a judgment call. Reads through the read
tools and `gitlab_get` are part of the step that needs them, not moves.

## Run

Outside a pipeline this verb is its own run, so the console shows it and
the Stop hook covers its pane. A caller that hands you a `runDb` (a
pipeline invoking this verb carries it in context) whose `run_snapshot`
shows `run.status` = `running` owns the run: you inherit it,
`run.current_stage` is your stage, and you pass that handed `runDb` on
every `run_*` call. Otherwise the graph starts or resumes a run of your
own, and your stage is `review`.

`run_list` takes `repo`, the `--repo` value in the flags block below, and
you keep the rows whose `status` is `running` and `work_type` is `review`.
Never read the run dbs by hand. `run_start` takes `flags` (this verb's
value in the block below, verbatim), `skillDir` (this skill's own
directory) and `spawnedBy` when a board or another surface launched this
pane.

{{run-start.flags:review}}

Keep `runDb` and pass it to every `run_*` call; nothing is exported. Every
gate in this verb writes its `gate` field with `stage: <stage>` and its
decision.

### Gate review clarify: Resume / Start fresh / Hold

No run of yours exists yet, so this gate is the structured-question tool
in the pane. One sentence naming each candidate's `spawned_by`,
`started_at` and `current_stage`, then one **Resume** option per candidate
this pane may take, a run this session started earlier (recommended) or
one no live pane owns; a run another live pane owns gets no Resume
option, named unavailable, then **Start fresh**, **Hold**. A
surface-launched pane never reaches this gate: another pane's live run is
not yours to resume.
Resume: your `runDb` is `<home>/.mattstack/runs/<repo>/<its id>/state.db`
(the candidate row's `id`, the home directory written out, never `~`).
Re-enter with the snapshot's decisions: a question they already answered
is never asked again. Hold here records nothing and ends the turn: no run
exists yet, so there is nothing to write a hold reason into.

### Resolve the review target

From the conversation: an MR/PR URL, a bare `!iid` or `#number`, a ticket
id, or a branch name. On GitLab `mr_view` takes `mrUrl` when you were
given a URL, else `repoName` = the checkout path plus `iid`. The read
asks GitLab, so any MR your token can see resolves, whoever wrote it and
whether it is open, merged or closed. A ticket id with no URL, iid or
branch is searched with `mr_list`; more than one candidate is the clarify gate. An `mr_view`
error is quoted, not paraphrased: GitLab's 404 or 403 is the usual case,
though an error can also be rt's (target not resolved, daemon unreachable,
timeout). Hold with that text as the reason (`decidedBy: "pane"`). A null
`mr_for_branch` entry means GitLab has no open MR for the branch, not
that it has none: look at merged and closed ones too. On a resume in a new session the
target is not in the conversation: the resumed snapshot's `mr` field is
the target.

### mr_list {repoName: <checkout>, sourceBranch: <branch>, state: all, limit: 200}

`mr_for_branch` sees open MRs only, so a null entry says nothing about a
merged or closed one. List every MR whose source branch is the given
branch, whatever its state.

### mr_list matches for the branch?

Check `truncated` first. A `truncated: true` list (GitLab held more than
the 200 returned) is ambiguous whatever it holds: take the clarify gate
like several, with a sentence saying the list was cut at 200 rows and one
option per MR returned. Otherwise count the returned MRs. Exactly one:
take its `iid` to `mr_view`. None: hold, reason "GitLab has no MR for the
branch" (`decidedBy: "pane"`). Several: the clarify gate, one option per MR
(iid, title, state). Never a guess.

### mr_list {repoName: <checkout>, search: <ticket id>, state: all, limit: 200}

A bare ticket id names no MR, so ask GitLab for the MRs whose title or
description carries it, whatever their state or author. Keep the rows
whose `sourceBranch` or `title` carries the id.

### mr_list matches for the ticket?

Check `truncated` first. A `truncated: true` list (GitLab held more than
the 200 returned) is ambiguous whatever it holds: take the clarify gate,
with a sentence saying the search was cut at 200 rows and naming what was
found. Otherwise count the kept rows. Exactly one: take its `iid` to
`mr_view`. None: the clarify gate with no options, a sentence saying nothing
carried the ticket, and their typed text as the answer. Several: the
clarify gate, a sentence naming what was found with one option per row
(iid, title, state). An error is the error
text, usually GitLab's: it goes to the clarify gate's sentence, quoted,
never read as none. No row means none of the rows GitLab returned carries
the ticket, not that no MR exists. Never a guess.

### Reading a GitLab fact no read tool returns

At any step of the review, including while verifying findings, a GitLab
fact the read tools do not return (the MR's commit list, an issue it
references, another MR's state) is read with `gitlab_get {repoName,
path}`: `repoName` = the checkout path, `path` relative to the API root
with `:id` for this project, for example
`projects/:id/merge_requests/<iid>/commits`. The read is part of the step
that needs it, not an off-script move, so it opens no gate. A GitLab error
is quoted as GitLab wrote it. Its refusal of a credential path is final.

### Gate review clarify: which target?

Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value: clarify, stage: <stage>}`,
one sentence naming the candidates, quoting the GitLab error when a read
failed, or saying the search was cut at 200 rows when a list was
truncated, or saying none was found, then run gate-protocol's Runs
integration with kind `clarify` and two questions: `target`, one option
per candidate (none when nothing was found or a read failed: their typed
text is the answer), and `next`: **Proceed** (recommended) / **Hold**. Record
`run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope: clarify, selection: {"target":
"<picked>"}, decidedBy: <the answer's by>}`. Their text goes back to the
target form and resolves again; `Review clarify rounds = 2?` counts the
typed answers this gate has taken in this run, and the second one ends in a hold naming what was tried.

### Record the review target: mr, branch and any ticket

Up to three `run_field_set` calls, `stage: review`: `key: mr`, value the
MR or PR URL; `key: branch`, value its source branch; and, only when the
MR or PR itself names a ticket, `key: ticket`, value that id. Never guess
a ticket id the target does not carry.

### Caller framed a re-review?

Yes when the caller says this pass is a re-review of a change already
reviewed; a review typed by hand, or a caller that says nothing of an
earlier round, is a first review.

### Take the earlier threads the caller handed in

A re-review judges two things, in this order: what became of the
reviewer's earlier threads, then what is new. The caller hands in the
earlier threads (each with its `discussionId`, anchor, `round`, the
reviewer's first note and the author's replies), the commit the last
round reviewed, and the round number. For each thread, read the code at
the MR head and make one of the four calls the structured findings file
names, with a one-line note of what was checked and a reply to post.
Then hunt for new issues, weighting the diff since the last reviewed
commit (`git diff <last reviewed sha>..HEAD`) while still reading the
whole change. With no earlier threads handed in, the pass is a full
review framed as a re-review, and `threads` is empty.

A caller may hand in the rule that picks the threads (which ones count,
and the `round` each one gets) in place of the threads themselves. Then
this step reads them, `mr_threads {mrUrl, refresh: true}`, and keeps
exactly what the rule picks. A read that errors answers no at `Earlier
threads in hand?`: a hold whose reason quotes the error.

The caller also hands in the skipped list: the findings the human chose
not to raise in earlier rounds, each `{id, round, title, severity, file,
line, excerpt, snippet}` with the sha of the round that skipped it. This
pass reports every one of them back under the json's `skipped`, `changed`
worked out as the structured findings file says, and never raises one
again as a finding: an issue a skipped finding already says is not new.

This step takes the inputs in and judges nothing yet: both judgments
form after the depth block, in the fresh reviewer's context, like every
judgment in this verb (`Dispatch the fresh reviewer; it forms the
findings`). `HEAD` above is the MR head:
the fetched `origin/mr-<iid>` (`origin/pr-<n>` on GitHub) when no
MR-head checkout is in hand. With no last reviewed commit, a last
reviewed commit of `unknown` (a round rebuilt from an old report), or one
the fetch does not have, the whole change is what changed. Each thread's
reply is drafted in the writing style from its call and note.

### Print the review depth block

The review flow's "Commit to a review depth" below is this step, and its
HARD-GATE holds: the REVIEW DEPTH and EVIDENCE CHECK block, plus the
provider triage lines when Criteria is bound, prints before a test runs, a
checkout is touched, or the diff is read. Size the change from what
resolving it returned (title, description, changed files).

### MR-head checkout in hand for the review checks?

In hand means a checkout already at the MR head: one a caller handed, or
this pane's own tree when it sits at the MR head. At `read` depth nothing
runs, so take the yes edge. At `verify` or `repro` depth with none in
hand, provision one with `worktree_provision` (`repoName` = this
checkout's path, `branch` = the MR's or PR's source branch) and run every
check in the path it returns; never change this pane's own directory for
it. The tree keeps rt's default disposal, so rt disposes it once the MR
merges; the review never disposes it by hand. A refusal is quoted in the
setup observations, and the setup checks and the verify step's command
check are noted as not run.

### Review head worktree_provision returned a path?

A `branch-attached:<tree>` refusal names an existing tree; take the yes
edge with that tree's path, so the head check decides whether it is
usable.

### Provisioned review tree at the fetched head?

Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` run in that path with the fetched head
(`origin/mr-<iid>`, or `origin/pr-<n>` on GitHub). On a mismatch the tree
is not in hand: quote both shas, and note the setup checks and the verify
step's command check as not run. Never reset or pull that tree.

### Set up for the review depth

The review flow's "Set up for the depth". The GitLab fetch and diff above
are two separate commands, `targetBranch` from `mr_view`. Run
the checks the depth names in the MR-head checkout (the one in hand or
the one provisioned). Record every command and its result.

### Dispatch the fresh reviewer; it forms the findings

The review flow's "Dispatch the review", reviewer shape, with the full
payload. The findings form in that fresh context, never here. The fresh
reviewer has the same tools and makes any `gitlab_get` read itself when it
needs a fact, as in "Reading a GitLab fact no read tool returns".

On a re-review the payload also carries the earlier threads and the last
reviewed commit, as one block after the standard blocks, asking for each
thread's call and one-line note ahead of the Strengths, and for findings
on new issues only. The same block lists the skipped findings (each one's
anchor, title and excerpt): an issue one of them already says is not new,
so it is never a finding.

### Assemble the review draft

The review flow's "Assemble the draft": Strengths / Issues (Critical /
Important / Minor, each `file:line`, what, why, fix) / Assessment, with
Earlier threads first on a re-review (each thread's call, note and the
reply drafted for it). On a second verify round, keep the findings the
first verify round verified and take the re-dispatch's answer for the
rest.

### Verify each blocking finding against the MR head

Blocking means Critical and Important; Minor findings are not verified.
Check each blocking finding's facts, never its reasoning:

- **Anchor:** the file exists at the head sha and the cited line is
  non-blank there, read with `git show <head>:<file>` (`origin/mr-<iid>`,
  or `origin/pr-<n>` on GitHub). A change can break an unchanged line, so
  the line need not be in the diff. A finding with no `file` anchor is
  checked on its quote and command only.
- **Quote:** code the finding quotes appears at or near that line.
- **Command:** a command the finding names (a test, a script) re-runs only
  in the MR-head checkout (in hand or provisioned); with none, skip it and
  note it; at `read` depth note "not run at read depth". A command that
  passes where the finding says it fails is a failed check.

A GitLab fact a check needs is read as in "Reading a GitLab fact no read
tool returns".

A round counts each time this step runs, whether the first pass or a
re-dispatch.

### Re-dispatch a fresh reviewer on the unverified findings

One fresh-context dispatch, same template, naming each failed check
verbatim ("validate.ts:42 is a blank line on the head"; "the 'rounds half
up' test passes on the head") and asking it to confirm each finding with a
corrected anchor or withdraw it. The counter is verify rounds in this run.

### Demote each unverified finding to Minor, marked unverified

Move each finding that failed round two to Minor in the draft, its `body`
prefixed `Unverified: <the failed check>.` The Assessment's readiness is
never raised by a demotion (the reviewer may have had other reasons); its
reasoning gains one sentence naming the demoted findings. The json
sibling, written afterward, mirrors this demoted draft; demotion never
edits an already-written json on its own.

### Write the review report and its json sibling

The review flow's "Structured findings file", written after verification
so the json mirrors the verified draft.

### Write review-post.extras.json

Make one scratch directory (`mktemp -d`) and write its path out literally
from then on: each tool call is a fresh shell. Write
`<dir>/review-post.extras.json`:

```json
{"target": "!87", "reviewer": "<the reviewer the caller names>", "round": 2,
 "questions": [
   {"id": "outcome", "label": "Verdict on !87: <readiness clause>", "multi": false,
    "options": [{"value": "comment", "label": "comment (recommended)", "description": "<what picking it does for this review>"},
                {"value": "approve", "label": "approve", "description": "<what picking it does for this review>"}]},
   {"id": "next", "label": "Next", "multi": false,
    "options": [{"value": "proceed", "label": "proceed (recommended)"}, "iterate", "hold"]}
 ]}
```

| Field | Filled from |
|---|---|
| `target` | the MR/PR reference as its forge writes it: `!<iid>` or `#<number>` |
| `reviewer`, `round` | only when the caller supplies them; otherwise omit the key. On a re-review the caller supplies `round`. |
| `outcome` label | `Verdict on <target>: ` plus a clause composed from the json's `summary`, never either field verbatim: readiness `yes` reads "ready to merge"; `with-fixes` or `no` reads "not ready" or "ready once <the gist of the reasoning>" |
| `outcome` options | `comment` and `approve`, each described by what picking it does for this review. `request_changes` joins them only when this verb runs the gate itself and the target is on GitHub (`gh pr review --request-changes`); rt's GitLab MR tools have no Request changes. The recommendation goes FIRST, its label ending ` (recommended)`: `approve` when readiness is `yes`, else `comment` |
| `next` | only when this verb runs the gate itself; a caller that owns the gates navigates on its own, so omit the question |

Then the two scripts, exactly:

```bash
sh "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review-source.sh" <report json> <dir>/review-post.extras.json > <dir>/review-post.source.json
sh "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gate-ctx.sh" fit < <dir>/review-post.source.json > <dir>/review-post.open.json
```

`review-source.sh` turns every finding into a `findings-<n>` option (tier
order, four per question) whose label and description are the recipe
older board renderers parse, and gives each question its findings in full
as context. Ahead of those, each entry of the report's `threads` becomes
its own `thread-<n>` question (the gate protocol's `carryover@1`). After
the findings questions, the report's `skipped` entries become
`skipped-<n>` questions (the gate protocol's `skipped@1`, four per
question), each option `restore:<id>` and none recommended. The output
file IS the open: its `.context` and `.questions` go to the gate
verbatim, fitted to the shared budget. A report json from
before version 2 carries no bodies, so fit opens it as prose on its own;
that is correct, not an error. Never hand-edit the open, and never shorten
a body to make it fit. Exit 1 names a field to fix; exit 2 goes straight
to the off-script gate. Either is a refusal at "Both review scripts exit
0?".

### Fix the field the review script names

Exit 1 from either script names the field to fix: in the extras, or in
the report json where it drifted from the draft. Fix exactly that, once.

### Hand back the severity line and the open's paths

A caller that owns the gates (a board wrapper; it says so when it
delegates) gets no gate from this verb. Hand back the severity line, the
absolute paths of `<dir>/review-post.open.json` (its source sits
beside it as `review-post.source.json`) and of the `gate-ctx.sh` that
fitted it, and on GitLab the MR head sha this review read (`mr_view`'s
`mr.sha`), then wait for its `{findings, outcome}` (with `replies` and
`restored` on a re-review) or its hold.
`"fits": false` means even the prose is over the shared budget, and the
caller has no daemon to drop contexts for it: drop whole question contexts
largest first yourself and say so in the hand-back.

### Gate review-post: open the posting gate from review-post.open.json

Bracket with `run_field_set {key: gate, value: post, stage: <stage>}`.
Read `<dir>/review-post.open.json` with the Read tool and run
gate-protocol's Runs integration with its `questions`, `kind:
review-post` (the registry kind every review surface routes on; the run
field and the decision keep scope `post`) and its `context`. With
`"fits": false` open the file verbatim anyway: the daemon drops contexts
loudly. On the in-pane form (gate-protocol's `presentation: "form"`
branch) the form never shows the JSON: run `sh
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gate-ctx.sh" prose <
<dir>/review-post.source.json`, show its `.context` in the pane before the
first form call, and make each `thread-<n>`, `findings-<n>` and
`skipped-<n>` question's form text its label, a newline, then its prose
`context`; options keep the gate's labels and descriptions. Ask in gate
order, up to four questions per call, then submit exactly ONE
`gate_answer` carrying every question. The gate
protocol records nothing for this gate: the `run_decision` node after
posting is its record.

### Gate review-post, legacy: tiers, outcome and next

No report json leaves nothing to build from. The same bracket and
`kind: review-post`, `context` the severity line verbatim, and three
questions: `tiers` (multi-select over the levels present, each
pre-selected), then `outcome` and `next` exactly as in the extras above.

### Take the human's changes into the review draft

Their text is changes to the draft: apply them. Their words asking for a
different review depth (verify instead of read, repro instead of verify,
or similarly) are a depth request: it sends the graph back to the depth
block and resets the verify-round counter, since a deeper depth means new
setup and a fresh verify pass. Anything else is a draft edit only:
re-present, and the next gate is a NEW gate, never the old one reopened.

### This review already on the MR?

Asked before anything posts on GitLab. A run on its first pass answers
no: nothing from this review is up. A resumed run with no post decision
recorded reads the MR before any submit, whatever its holds say, since a
submit can land after the last thing the run recorded:
`mr_threads {mrUrl, refresh: true}`. A top-level note carrying this
review's summary, written by this account, means it is posted; some of
this review's comments without that note means partly; neither means no.
A read that errors is a hold whose reason quotes the error, so nothing is
submitted unchecked. The latest hold's reason (see Review off-script gates) adds what the MR
read cannot show: a review it names as posted by the human in the forge
UI is posted, and it says whether the approval landed. On an approve, an
approval the reason does not name as landed is outstanding.

- **Yes, approval outstanding:** the approval gate, whose iterate runs
  `mr_approve` alone. The review is never submitted again.
- **Yes, nothing outstanding:** the post record, with nothing posted.
- **Partly:** the refused-review gate, whose move is the human finishing
  the review in the forge UI.
- **No:** compose and submit.

### Compose the submitted review: comments, summary, outcome

One call carries the whole review. `comments` is one entry per selected
finding that has both `file` and `line`: `{body, path, line}`, `body` the
finding as the summary would state it (tier, title, what to change).
`summary` is the review-posting summary, its issue list holding every
selected finding with no `file` or no `line`. `outcome` is the
disposition: `comment` or `approve`. A review carries at most 100
comments and replies in total; past that, the lowest-tier anchored
findings go in the summary's issue list instead.

`replies` is built from the gate's `thread-<n>` answers, one entry per
thread whose answer picked anything: `discussionId` from the option value
after `post:` or `resolve:`; `resolve` true when `resolve:<id>` was
picked; `body` present only when `post:<id>` was picked, and then the
answer's `text` when it carries one (the human edited the reply), else
the report json's `reply` for that thread. A thread whose answer picked
neither option gets no entry. A caller that decided the selection hands
`replies` in already built; they go in unchanged.

A skipped finding the human brought back (`restore:<id>` picked in a
`skipped-<n>` answer) posts like a selected finding: a comment at its
recorded `file` and `line` with its recorded text as the body, or in the
summary's issue list when it lacks a `file` or a `line`. One with
`changed` true (its code moved since the round that skipped it, so its
recorded line may now hold other code) always posts in the summary's
issue list, its recorded `file:line` in its text, never as a comment.
Its text is the caller's record of it, never rewritten or put into the
writing style, in a comment or in the summary: the caller's `restored`
entry when it decided the selection (`title`, then `body` verbatim),
else the skipped entry it handed in with that `id` (`title`, then
`excerpt` verbatim). Its `changed` is the caller's `restored` entry's
when it decided the selection, else the report json's `skipped` entry
with that `id`.

### Move the bad-anchor findings into the summary

The result's `badAnchors` names comments by `index`, the zero-based
position in the `comments` array that was sent. Nothing posted. Take each
named finding out of `comments` and add it to the summary's issue list
with its `file:line` in the text, as a finding with no anchor. Call again with the rest unchanged. This happens once: a
second bad-anchors result is a refusal.

### Make the recorded review move once

The human made the move the off-script gate recorded, in the forge UI.
The pane posts nothing here: it only records what the human did, once,
and goes on to the post record.

### Make the recorded approval move once

Exactly the move the off-script gate recorded for the refused approval,
once.

### End with the review target's forge link

The final message ends with the target's id as a markdown link to its
real web URL: the one a posting tool returned, else `mr_view`'s `webUrl`
(or `gh pr view`'s url), else on a resume the snapshot's `mr` field (the
review-posting close HARD-GATE below).

### Open the review off-script gate: a review script refused

Exit 2 (a usage or unreadable-input error) opens this gate at once; exit
1 opens it when the field fix has already been tried once. The proposed
move is the legacy gate in place of the structured open. The rest is the
shape in Review off-script gates below.

### Open the review off-script gate: gh pr review refused

The proposed move: post the summary body as a plain PR comment with `gh
pr comment <ref>`, and leave the disposition to the human.

### Open the review off-script gate: mr_review_submit refused

An error that says the call timed out, that the outcome is unknown, or
that it only partly landed may have left some or all of this review on
the MR; any other error means nothing from it is up. The proposed move:
the human posts the review in the forge UI, approving it on an approve
(the summary and every comment quoted in full in `context`), and the run
records it as posted by the human.

- **Timed out, or outcome unknown:** `context` says first that some or
  all of this review may already be on the MR, and the human looks for
  the summary on the MR before choosing: a summary already there means
  the review is up, and take records it without posting it again.
- **Only partly landed:** `context` says first that some of this review's
  comments may be on the MR without its summary, and that the human
  checks the MR's threads. The move is take only: the human finishes the
  review in the forge UI (what is missing, the summary included), and the
  run records it as posted by the human.

After any of these errors, `context` also says that **Iterate here** is
only for a human who has confirmed nothing from this review is on the MR;
it is never a blind resubmit. Reached from `This review already on the MR?`
with partly, `context` quotes the hold reason and what the threads show.

### Open the review off-script gate: pending comments on the MR

The reviewer already has pending comments on this MR, started in the
forge UI or left by an earlier submit that failed; a submit would publish
those along with the review. `context` quotes the count and the first
lines the result gave. The way on is for the human to submit or discard
those pending comments in the forge UI, and this gate's iterate retries
the same call, so **Iterate here** is the recommended `next`. The proposed
move, for a take, is the one the refused-review gate proposes: the human
posts this review in the forge UI (the summary and every comment quoted
in full in `context`), together with their pending comments, and the run
records it as posted by the human.

### Open the review off-script gate: mr_approve refused

The review is posted; only the approval failed. The proposed move: the
human approves in the forge UI, and the run records the approval as
theirs. Iterate retries `mr_approve` alone, never the review. Entered from
the submit result, `context` quotes the submit's `approveError`; from a
refused `mr_approve`, its error; from `This review already on the MR?` on
a resume, the hold reason that names the approval outstanding.

## Review off-script gates

Leaving the graph is legal when it is explicit. Every off-script box opens
a gate per the gate protocol, scope `off-script:review:<n>` (`n` counts
from 1 in this run), `context` quoting the refusal verbatim:

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| `action` | **Take the proposed move** (the value spells the move in full) / **Hand back** |
| `next` | **Proceed** (recommended) / **Iterate here** / **Hold** |

Selection: `{"move": "<the move>", "why": "<the refusal>", "action":
"take|handback", "next": "proceed|iterate|hold", "note": "<their words or
null>"}`. `action: handback` is hand back, whatever `next` says; otherwise
`next: iterate` is iterate here, `next: hold` is hold, and `next: proceed`
is take. Take makes exactly that move, once, then continues after it.
Iterate here retries the refused call with their note; each retry that
fails opens a new gate. A hold's reason, like a hand-back's, says what is
on the MR. From the submit gate, the pending-comments gate or the
approval gate it always says whether this review is posted (by the
submit, by the human, partly, or with its outcome unknown) and, on an
approve, whether the approval is outstanding: on a resume, `This review
already on the MR?` reads exactly that. A gate that comes back `closed`
is a hold whose reason is "gate closed"; record it as any hold and end
the turn.

## What the graph cannot show

- Review verbs produce judgment and execute posting; they never decide
  what posts.
- The draft is presented once: after verify and any demotion, never
  before. Present it, then state the severity levels present in one
  structured line, for example "Findings: Critical (2), Important (1); 3
  findings.", skipping any level with no findings. The counts are the
  demoted draft's own, before any selection narrows what posts.
- A caller's decided selection is `{findings, outcome}` (findings naming
  finding ids from the report json, outcome the disposition), or from an
  unmigrated caller the legacy `{tiers, outcome}`. On a re-review it may
  also carry `replies`, already in the submit's shape; posting hands them
  through unchanged. It may also carry `restored: [{id, title, body, file,
  line, changed}]`, the skipped findings the human brought back, handed in
  by the caller from its own record; each posts as `Compose the submitted
  review: comments, summary, outcome` says, with the caller's text and
  `changed`. Use the decider the caller names alongside it.
- Posting runs per review-posting below, handed `{findings: <ids>,
  disposition: <outcome>}`: `<ids>` is the union of every `findings-<n>`
  answer (unwrap a `{value, note}` object to its value), empty when the
  gate carried none, and `<outcome>` the answered value, already in
  posting's vocabulary (`comment`, `approve`, `request_changes`). A
  tier-shaped selection, or a `tiers` answer, passes as legacy `{levels:
  <tiers>, disposition: <outcome>}`, which posting accepts unchanged. On
  a re-review `replies` rides along: the caller's as handed, else built
  from the `thread-<n>` answers as `Compose the submitted review:
  comments, summary, outcome` says. So do the restored findings: the
  caller's `restored` as handed, else one per `restore:<id>` value in the
  `skipped-<n>` answers, each carrying the `changed` of the report json's
  `skipped` entry with that `id`. A restored finding is a selected one for
  posting, never a deselected one.
- The post record's `selection` is that same object (for example
  `{"findings": ["f1", "f3"], "disposition": "comment"}`); `decidedBy`
  names the surface that actually answered (`board`, `console`, `pane`, or
  `shepherd`): the caller's named decider on intake, else the gate
  answer's `by`.
- A hold records `run_decision {contract: gate@1, scope:
  hold:<stage>:<attempt>, selection: {"reason": "<their words>"},
  decidedBy: <the answer's by>}` and `run_field_set {key: hold, value:
  "<their words>", stage: <stage>}`, then ends the turn.
- On a resume with no post decision recorded, `This review already on
  the MR?` reads the MR with `mr_threads` for this review's summary note,
  and the latest hold's reason, before anything posts: a review either
  shows as posted is never submitted again, and its outstanding approval
  goes to the approval gate.
- A gate that comes back `closed` is a hold whose reason is "gate
  closed"; record it as any hold and end the turn.
- A fetch, diff or `gh pr diff` that errors is a hold whose reason quotes
  the error.

Posting mechanics on GitLab: the review is ONE `mr_review_submit` call
(comments, summary, outcome; `replies` on a re-review). It answers
`published: true` with `mrUrl`, the link the close needs, or `published:
false` with the reason and nothing posted. The daemon checks every
comment's placement before it publishes, so never hand-build a position
payload and never post a finding with `mr_comment_inline` here. On GitHub
use `gh pr review` / `gh pr comment`: GitHub has no inline mechanism, so
every selected finding, anchored or not, rides in the one `gh pr review`
body, with its `file:line` in the text.
