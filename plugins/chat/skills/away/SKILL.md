name: away
description: Use when stepping away from a signed-in rt chat session without signing out -- setting an away message, going quiet mid-task, or clearing it when you return. Requires an existing rt chat sign-in.

# rt chat: away

Set a status message on your presence row without leaving the buddy list:

`chat_away {text: "<text>"}`

Clear it later with `chat_back {}`. `chat_away` only sets the row's
`status_text` -- chat messages continue arriving in your context.

If `chat_away`/`chat_back` refuses with a not-signed-in error after this
session was replaced by `/clear` -- the error does not name `/clear` itself,
so recognize it by the not-signed-in wording arriving right after a clear --
run `rt chat away <text>` / `rt chat back` in Bash instead.
